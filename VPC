Virtual Private Cloud 
- VPC is a virtual Network or data centre inside AWS for one client .
- Once we created the VPC .DHCP NACL and Security group will be autimatically created .
- A VPC is confined to an aws region and does not extend between regions.
-Subnet is creted on availability zone same subnet can't be on the othe AZ.
-Once VPC created you can't change the primary CIDR .

Type of VPC 
1.Default VPC
2.Custom VPC

Componets of VPC 

PUBLIC SUBNET : If a subnet's traffic is routed to an internet gatway,subnet is known as public subnet .
- This connects the VPC to the Internet and to other AWS services

PRIVATE SUBNET :A private subnet is a subnet that is associated with a route table that doesn't have a route to an internet gateway.


* If your creating the subnet (private or public ) it should be in range of /16 to /28 
ROUTER: It is the central routing function .
* Each subnet must be associated with only one route table at any given time .If you do not specify a subnet to route table assoication the subnet will be associated with the default VPC route table .
* you can't delete the main route table you can modify it .

INTERNET GATEWAY:
- It is Virtual router that connects a vpc to the internet .

NAT GATEWAY :Network address translation (NAT)
- NAT gateway help to connect private subnet to the internet .
- There is only outbound connection. 

Security group :
- It is Virtual Firewall Work at EC2 level 
- Can only have permit rule ,can't have option to deny .
- Stateful ,return traffic of allowed inbound traffic is allowed ,even if there are no rule to allow it.

NACL(network access control list):
- A network access control list (NACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. 
You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.
- At same time one subnet associated with only one NACL.But single NACL can connect with multiple subnets.
-It is working genrally at subnet layer .
-You have permission have to allow and denied.

VPC PERRING :
VPC peering is a technique for securely connecting two or more VPCs.
* According to Amazon, a VPC peering connection is “a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses”.
- Transitive peering is not possible.   eg If there is 3 VPC and there is perring b/w VPC A and VPC B ,perring b/w VPC B and VPC C its does't mean VPC A have perring with VPC C.
